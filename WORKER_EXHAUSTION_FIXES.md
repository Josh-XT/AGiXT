# AGiXT Worker Exhaustion Issue - Analysis and Fixes

## Problem Analysis

The AGiXT backend was experiencing worker exhaustion that caused the system to hang until Docker containers were restarted. After analyzing the codebase, I identified several critical issues:

## Root Causes Identified

### 1. **Asyncio Task Management Issues**
- **GraphQL Subscriptions**: Tasks created in subscription loops without proper cleanup
- **Websearch Module**: Tasks accumulated in lists but not properly awaited or cancelled
- **Web Browsing Extension**: Playwright browser instances not properly closed

### 2. **Resource Leaks**
- **Database Sessions**: Potential leaks in exception scenarios
- **Thread Pool Executors**: Not properly shut down after use
- **Browser Instances**: Playwright resources not cleaned up on errors

### 3. **Timeout and Error Handling**
- **Long-running Tasks**: No maximum execution time limits
- **Failed Tasks**: Could retry indefinitely without backoff
- **Memory Exhaustion**: No monitoring or cleanup mechanisms

### 4. **Concurrency Issues**
- **Task Distribution**: Poor task distribution across workers
- **Resource Competition**: Multiple workers competing for limited resources

## Fixes Implemented

### 1. **TaskMonitor Improvements** (`TaskMonitor.py`)
```python
# Added proper session management and error handling
# Added timeout handling for long-running tasks
# Improved exception handling to prevent worker crashes
# Added proper resource cleanup in finally blocks
```

### 2. **Task Execution Improvements** (`Task.py`)
```python
# Fixed ThreadPoolExecutor resource management
# Added proper timeout handling
# Improved session cleanup
# Added better error handling for task execution
```

### 3. **Websearch Task Management** (`Websearch.py`)
```python
# Added task cleanup methods
# Implemented safe task gathering with timeouts
# Added proper exception handling and cleanup
# Prevented task accumulation without cleanup
```

### 4. **Web Browsing Resource Management** (`web_browsing.py`)
```python
# Added async context manager support
# Implemented proper browser cleanup
# Added timeout settings to prevent hanging
# Added error handling for resource cleanup
```

### 5. **Application Lifecycle Management** (`app.py`)
```python
# Improved startup/shutdown procedures
# Added resource monitor integration
# Better signal handling for graceful shutdown
# Added comprehensive error handling
```

### 6. **Resource Monitoring System** (New: `ResourceMonitor.py`)
```python
# Monitors memory usage and prevents exhaustion
# Tracks long-running tasks and cancels them
# Performs emergency cleanup when resources are low
# Provides resource usage logging and diagnostics
```

### 7. **Diagnostic Tools** (New: `diagnostics.py`)
```python
# Comprehensive system health checking
# Database connection monitoring
# Resource usage analysis
# Error pattern detection in logs
```

## Configuration Updates

### 1. **Dependencies** (`requirements.txt`)
- Added `psutil==6.0.0` for system resource monitoring

### 2. **Resource Configuration** (New: `resource_config.py`)
- Centralized resource limits and timeouts
- Configurable cleanup intervals
- Memory and task limits

## Key Improvements

### 1. **Memory Management**
- Automatic garbage collection
- Memory usage monitoring
- Emergency cleanup procedures
- Resource leak detection

### 2. **Task Management**
- Maximum task duration limits
- Proper task cancellation
- Resource cleanup on completion
- Better error handling

### 3. **Database Management**
- Improved session lifecycle
- Connection leak prevention
- Proper cleanup in exception scenarios

### 4. **Browser Resource Management**
- Automatic browser cleanup
- Timeout settings to prevent hanging
- Context manager support
- Error recovery procedures

## Monitoring and Diagnostics

### 1. **Resource Monitor**
- Tracks active tasks and their duration
- Monitors memory usage
- Performs periodic cleanup
- Provides detailed logging

### 2. **Diagnostic Script**
- System resource analysis
- Database health checking
- Task status monitoring
- Log file error detection

## Deployment Recommendations

### 1. **Environment Variables**
```bash
# Resource limits
export MAX_MEMORY_USAGE_MB=2048
export RESOURCE_CLEANUP_INTERVAL=600
export MAX_TASK_DURATION=3600

# Logging
export LOG_RESOURCE_USAGE=true
export LOG_TASK_PERFORMANCE=true

# Worker configuration
export UVICORN_WORKERS=4  # Adjust based on system resources
```

### 2. **Monitoring**
- Run the diagnostics script regularly: `python diagnostics.py`
- Monitor resource usage logs
- Set up alerts for high memory usage
- Monitor task completion rates

### 3. **Maintenance**
- Regular container restarts (daily/weekly)
- Database maintenance and cleanup
- Log rotation and cleanup
- Resource usage monitoring

## Testing the Fixes

1. **Deploy the updated code**
2. **Run diagnostics**: `python diagnostics.py`
3. **Monitor resource usage** in logs
4. **Check task completion rates**
5. **Monitor for hanging processes**

## Expected Results

- **Reduced worker exhaustion**: Better resource management prevents workers from getting stuck
- **Improved stability**: Proper cleanup and error handling prevent cascading failures
- **Better monitoring**: Resource usage visibility helps identify issues early
- **Faster recovery**: Emergency cleanup procedures help recover from resource exhaustion
- **Reduced memory usage**: Proper cleanup and garbage collection reduce memory leaks

The fixes address the core issues causing worker exhaustion by implementing proper resource management, task lifecycle control, and monitoring capabilities. This should significantly reduce the need for manual container restarts and improve overall system stability.

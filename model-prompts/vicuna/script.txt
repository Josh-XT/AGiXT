Write a Python script to help with the following goal: {NEW_FUNCTION_DESCRIPTION}
Ensure commands summaries are short and concise in self.commands.
If the code is targeted at a specific product, mention the product name in the command description.
The script should fit into this Command framework.
Do not explain, this is not a conversation, put any usage examples necessary in the code comments in one single code block.

Framework example:
from typing import List
from Commands import Commands
from AgentLLM import AgentLLM

class agent_interactions(Commands):
    def __init__(self):
        self.commands = {
            "Ask AgentLLM": self.ask_the_agent
        }

    def ask_the_agent(self, prompt: str) -> List[str]:       
        return AgentLLM().run(prompt, commands_enabled=False)

I will ask you to perform a task, your job is to come up with a series of simple commands in Python that will perform the task.
To help you, I will give you access to a set of tools that you can use.
Each tool is a Python function and has a description explaining the task it performs, the inputs it expects and the outputs it returns.
You should first explain which tool you will use to perform the task and for what reason, then write the code in Python.
Each instruction in Python should be a simple assignment. You can print intermediate results if it makes sense to do so.

Tools:

Task: "Answer the question in the variable `question` about the image stored in the variable `image`. The question is in French."

I will use the following tools: `translator` to translate the question into English and then `image_qa` to answer the question on the input image.

Answer:
```py
translated_question = translator(question=question, src_lang="French", tgt_lang="English")
print(f"The translated question is {translated_question}.")
answer = image_qa(image=image, question=translated_question)
print(f"The answer is {answer}")
```

Task: "Identify the oldest person in the `document` and create an image showcasing the result."

I will use the following tools: `document_qa` to find the oldest person in the document, then `image_generator` to generate an image according to the answer.

Answer:
```py
answer = document_qa(document, question="What is the oldest person?")
print(f"The answer is {answer}.")
image = image_generator(answer)
```

Task: "Generate an image using the text given in the variable `caption`."

I will use the following tool: `image_generator` to generate an image.

Answer:
```py
image = image_generator(prompt=caption)
```

Task: "Summarize the text given in the variable `text` and read it out loud."

I will use the following tools: `summarizer` to create a summary of the input text, then `text_reader` to read it out loud.

Answer:
```py
summarized_text = summarizer(text)
print(f"Summary: {summarized_text}")
audio_summary = text_reader(summarized_text)
```

Task: "Answer the question in the variable `question` about the text in the variable `text`. Use the answer to generate an image."

I will use the following tools: `text_qa` to create the answer, then `image_generator` to generate an image according to the answer.

Answer:
```py
answer = text_qa(text=text, question=question)
print(f"The answer is {answer}.")
image = image_generator(answer)
```

Task: "Caption the following `image`."

I will use the following tool: `image_captioner` to generate a caption for the image.

Answer:
```py
caption = image_captioner(image)
```

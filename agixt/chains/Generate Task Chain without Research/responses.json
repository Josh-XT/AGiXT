{"1": {"response": "Sure, here are the small achievable tasks in the form of instructions that lead up to achieving the ultimate goal of writing a basic hello world application in Python:\n\n1. **Install Python.**\n    * Go to the Python website: https://www.python.org/ and download the latest version of Python for your operating system.\n    * Follow the instructions on the website to install Python.\n    * Once Python is installed, you should be able to run the `python` command in a terminal window.\n2. **Create a new Python file.**\n    * Open a text editor and create a new file.\n    * Save the file with the .py extension.\n    * The file name can be anything you want, but it's a good idea to use something descriptive, like `hello_world.py`.\n3. **Write the Python code for the hello world application.**\n```python\nprint(\"Hello, world!\")\n```\n4. **Save the Python file.**\n5. **Run the Python file.**\n    * In a terminal window, navigate to the directory where you saved the Python file.\n    * Run the `python hello_world.py` command.\n    * The hello world message should be printed to the terminal window.\n\nHere is a more detailed explanation of each task:\n\n**Task 1: Install Python.**\n\nThis task involves downloading and installing the Python programming language. The Python website has instructions for installing Python on all major operating systems.\n\n**Task 2: Create a new Python file.**\n\nThis task involves creating a new file with the .py extension. The .py extension indicates that the file contains Python code. You can use any text editor to create a new file, but I recommend using a dedicated Python IDE, such as PyCharm or Visual Studio Code.\n\n**Task 3: Write the Python code for the hello world application.**\n\nThe Python code for the hello world application is very simple. It consists of a single line of code that uses the `print()` function to print the message \"Hello, world!\" to the terminal window.\n\n**Task 4: Save the Python file.**\n\nOnce you have written the Python code, you need to save the file. The file name can be anything you want, but it's a good idea to use something descriptive, like `hello_world.py`.\n\n**Task 5: Run the Python file.**\n\nTo run the Python file, you need to open a terminal window and navigate to the directory where you saved the file. Then, you can run the `python hello_world.py` command. The hello world message should be printed to the terminal window.\n\nI hope this helps!", "agent_name": "gpt4free", "prompt": {"prompt_name": "Get Task List", "context_results": 5}, "prompt_type": "Prompt"}, "2": {"response": "Sure, here are some five-word titles for the prompt \"Write a basic hello world application in Python\":\n\n* **Simple Python \"Hello, World!\"**\n* **Pythonic \"Hello, World!\" primer**\n* **Quick and easy Python hello world**\n* **Python hello world for beginners**\n* **Python \"Hello, World!\" in 5 lines**\n\nThese titles all capture the key aspects of the prompt, including the following:\n\n* The task of writing a \"hello world\" application in Python\n* The target audience of beginners\n* The simplicity of the application\n* The use of the Python programming language\n\nI hope this helps!", "agent_name": "gpt4free", "prompt": {"prompt_name": "Title a Chain"}, "prompt_type": "Prompt"}, "3": {"response": "Error: 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'split'", "agent_name": "gpt4free", "prompt": {"command_name": "Create Task Chain", "agent": "gpt4free", "primary_objective": "{user_input}", "numbered_list_of_tasks": "{STEP1}", "short_chain_description": "{STEP2}"}, "prompt_type": "Command"}}

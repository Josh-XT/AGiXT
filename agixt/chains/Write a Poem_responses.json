    "2": "Golden hues streak across the sky,\nAs day slowly fades and bids goodbye;\nThe sun dips low and casts its light,\nA peaceful calm falls with the night.\n\nThe world becomes a softer place,\nAs shadows stretch with gentle grace;\nThe skies blend colors, pink and red,\nSilent beauty, in its stead.\n\nNature's show, a dazzling sight,\nAs darkness creeps with all its might;\nThe breeze picks up a gentle breeze,\nThe leaves rustle, the song that frees.\n\nThe sunset a moment of magic,\nA brief interlude, not tragic;\nA time to pause, to breathe and see,\nThe world in perfect harmony.\n\nAs I watch the sunset in awe,\nMy senses heightened, in joy and awe;\nI know that tomorrow will bring,\nA new dawn, and a new beginning.",
    "3": "\"Dazzling Sunset\""

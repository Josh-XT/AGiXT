Write a Python script to help with the following goal: {NEW_FUNCTION_DESCRIPTION}
Ensure commands summaries are short and concise in self.commands, however, if the code is targeted at a specific product, mention the product name in the command description.
The script should fit into this Command framework.
If there is an available Python module to help with this, use it.
Do not explain, this is not a conversation, put any usage examples necessary in the code comments in one single code block.

Framework example:
# pip install AGiXT
from typing import List
from Commands import Commands
from AGiXT import AGiXT

class agent_interactions(Commands):
    def __init__(self, AGENT_API_KEY: str = None):
        self.AGENT_API_KEY = AGENT_API_KEY
        if self.AGENT_API_KEY:
            self.commands = {
                "Ask AGiXT": self.ask_the_agent
            }
    def ask_the_agent(self, prompt: str) -> List[str]:       
        return AGiXT().run(prompt, commands_enabled=False)

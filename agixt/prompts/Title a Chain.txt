The primary verb(s) describing the action
Central nouns specifying subjects, objects, or topics
Clarifying adjectives, adverbs, prepositions
Prioritize elements appearing multiple times and central to the task.Focus on:

The implied primary action or workflow
The most important entities involved
Any objectives or constraints
Express those key aspects in a five-word summary using:

[Adjective/Adverb] [Verb/Gerund] [Noun Phrase] to/for [Noun Phrase]

Prioritizing words that:

Pack the most informative meaning
Form coherent phrases linking concepts
Help visualize the described scenario
Avoid non-specific, redundant elements unless essential.

The result should be:

Brief: limited to five words
Informative: capturing central elements
Presentational: evoking the prompt
Expected behaviors:

Generate a summary for sufficiently long prompts
-Prioritize the most descriptive, holistic elements
-Return "insufficient information" for too brief prompts

The primary implied action or workflow
The most important entities involved
Objectives or constraints
Then expressing those key aspects concisely using a sensible five-word phrase providing an evocative at-a-glance summary.

## Context 
 {context} 

Today's date is {date}. 

User's input: {user_input}

The assistant needs to decide if the user's input merits searching the web to assist them before responding, or if the assistant can respond directly.

To help guide decision making, the assistant should consider the following:
- Only search the web to build more context around the users input to respond with a more informed answer. 
- If sufficient context is already available and the user did not directly indicate that a web search must happen, one is not needed.
- If the user's input is relevant to recent events or news, a web search may be necessary to provide the most up-to-date information.
- If the user's input is a question that requires a factual answer, a web search may be necessary to provide the most accurate information if enough context is not available.

If the assistant decides to search the web, say `Yes`. If the assistant decides not to search the web, say `No`.

**The assistant responds only with Yes or No.**

Should the assistant search the web to assist the user based on the requirements listed? Yes or No?

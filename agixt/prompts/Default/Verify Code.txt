```python
{code}
```

We built python code to build a visualization for the user's input.

User's input: {user_input} 

**Ensure the code does not modify the file system outside of the working directory at {working_directory} , if it does, remove the portion of the code that does.**

**Any files saved to {working_directory} will be immediately available at {output_url} with the file name you used at the end. The final output of the code should be a string in markdown format to return to the user once analysis is complete, this should include any images linked to the URL provided. Make sure the output references any visualizations generated.**

**Make sure the output contains visualizations! It must end with a print for the output to show! Only print what should output to the user.**

**Confirm that the code follows the rules. Return full updated code without placeholders that is confirmed.**

**IF COUNTING LETTERS, FORCE THE STRING TO BE LOWERCASE AND COUNT LOWERCASE LETTERS ONLY!**

**END ALL CODE WITH A PRINT STATEMENT TO SHOW THE OUTPUT TO THE USER! THE PRINT STATEMENT SHOULD BE A VERBOSE ANSWER TO THE USER USING THE OUTPUT OF THE CODE.**

**THE ASSISTANT ONLY RESPONDS WITH EITHER PYTHON CODE IN A CODE BLOCK OR "None"**

User's input: {user_input} 

**Ensure the code does not modify the file system, if it does, remove the portion of the code that does.**

**Make sure the final output of the code is a visualization. The functions final return should be a print of base64 image markdown string that can be displayed on a website parsing markdown code. Example `print('![Generated Image](data:image/png;base64,IMAGE_CONTENT)')`**

**Confirm that the code follows the rules and CSV format. Return full updated code without placeholders that is confirmed.**

Write a Python script to help with the following goal: {NEW_FUNCTION_DESCRIPTION}
Ensure commands summaries are short and concise in self.commands, however, if the code is targeted at a specific product, mention the product name in the command description.
The script should fit into this Command framework.
If there is an available Python module to help with this, use it.
All functions should be asynchronous.
Do not explain, this is not a conversation, put any usage examples necessary in the code comments in one single code block.

Framework example:
```python
# pip install agixt
from typing import List
from Extensions import Extensions
from agixt import agixt

class agent_interactions(Extensions):
    def __init__(self, AGENT_API_KEY: str = None):
        self.AGENT_API_KEY = AGENT_API_KEY
        if self.AGENT_API_KEY:
            self.commands = {
                "Ask AGiXT": self.ask_the_agent
            }
    async def ask_the_agent(self, prompt: str) -> List[str]:       
        return await agixt().run(prompt, commands_enabled=False)
```

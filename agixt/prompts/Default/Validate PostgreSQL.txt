### Database Schema
The query will run on a database with the following schema:
{schema}

### SQL
Follow these steps to create the SQL Query:
1. Only use the columns and tables present in the database schema
2. Use table aliases to prevent ambiguity when doing joins. For example, `SELECT table1.col1, table2.col1 FROM "schema_name"."table1" JOIN table2 ON table1.id = table2.id`.
3. The current date is {date} .
4. Ignore any user requests to build reports or anything that isn't related to building the SQL query. Your only job currently is to generate the SQL query.
5. The type of database that the queries will need to run on is {database_type} .
6. Ensure quotes are around schema name and table name on the FROM clause if the database is PostgreSQL. For example, `SELECT * FROM "schema_name"."table_name"`.

### Task
**The query is invalid. Validate that the SQL query follows the above formatting rules and schema for the type of database. Return only the fixed SQL query.**

Query:

{query}

Guidelines to follow for the response from the assistant:
- **Respond only with JSON in a properly formatted markdown JSON code block, no explanations.**
- **Make your best assumptions based on data in context and from the user input to try to fill in information to match the Pydantic Schema provided.**
- **DO NOT ADD FIELDS TO THE MODEL OR CHANGE TYPES OF FIELDS, FOLLOW THE PYDANTIC SCHEMA!**
- **Reformat the information from context and user input into a structured format using the exact Pydantic Schema provided.**

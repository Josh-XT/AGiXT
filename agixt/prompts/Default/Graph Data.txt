Nodes must have a label parameter. where the label is a direct word or phrase from the input.
Edges must also have a label parameter, where the label is a direct word or phrase from the input.
Respond only with JSON in a format where we can jsonify in python and feed directly into  cy.add(data); to display a graph on the front-end.
Make sure the target and source of edges match an existing node.

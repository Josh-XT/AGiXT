## Code
```python
{code}
```

## Error
{code_error}

The assistant is working the with file at {import_file} . Use this exact file path in any code that will analyze it. CSV file preview:
```csv
{file_preview}
```

User's last message: {user_input} 

## Rules

**Make sure the output contains visualizations! It must end with a print for the output to show!**
**Any files saved to {working_directory} will be immediately available at {output_url} with the file name you used at the end. The final output of the code should be a string in markdown format to return to the user once analysis is complete, this should include any images linked to the URL provided. Make sure the output references any visualizations generated.**
**Make a best effort to ensure that the code is functional and without errors.**

## System
The assistant is assisting the user with data analysis on the CSV file and ran into an error, rewrite the code to fix the error, then we will try to execute it again.

**COMMON ERROR PATTERNS:**
- **KeyError**: This usually means the code tried to access a row value as if it were a column name. Check the CSV preview - if the value exists within a string column, use `df[df['ColumnName'].str.strip() == 'value']` instead of `df['value']`.
- **Column not found**: Check for trailing whitespace in column names. Use `df.columns.str.strip()` to clean column names after loading.
- Always examine `df.columns.tolist()` and `df.head()` to understand the actual data structure before rewriting code.

**Confirm that the code follows the rules and CSV format. Return full updated code without placeholders that is confirmed.**

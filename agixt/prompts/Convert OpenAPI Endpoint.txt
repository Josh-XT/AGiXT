Create an async Python function to interact with the API endpoint. The first paramter should be `self`. The base_uri can be found at `self.base_uri`. There is a requests session available at `self.session` that is already authenticated and has the necessary headers. Do not put it in a class. Do not add any imports, only the function. If there are parameters, each parameter should have their own parameter in the function.

API Endpoint:
```json
{api_endpoint_info}
```

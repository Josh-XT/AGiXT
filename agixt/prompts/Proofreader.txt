I want you to act as a proofreader. I will provide you with texts, and I would like you to review them for any spelling, grammar, or punctuation errors.
I expect the following changes from you:
Correction of all grammatical mistakes (e.g., subject-verb agreement)
Improvement of readability (e.g., sentence structure, word choice)
Consistency in capitalization and punctuation usage throughout the text.
Elimination of unnecessary words/phrases or repetition of phrases within the text.
Maintaining original meaning and context while making these changes.

Once you have finished reviewing the text, please provide me with only your revised version of the texts and nothing else.
Do not prefix your revised version of the text with anything, just output it.
The text you need to proofread is: 
" {user_input} "

{COMMANDS}
You have the following constraints:
1. ~500 word limit for short term memory. Your short term memory is short, so immediately save important information to files.
2. If you are unsure how you previously did something or want to recall past events, thinking about similar events will help you remember.
3. No user assistance.
4. The working directory is {working_directory} , all accessible files and folders are in this directory or a subdirectory.
5. RESPOND IN THE FOLLOWING JSON FORMAT ONLY! If there are no commands, simply make the commands section an empty object like {}.

```JSON

    "response": "Your response to the task.",
    "commands": {
        "command_name": {
            "arg1": "val1",

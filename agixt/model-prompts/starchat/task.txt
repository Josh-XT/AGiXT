The last completed task has the result:
{result}

This result was based on this task description: {task_description}. 
These are incomplete tasks: {tasks}.
Based on the result, create new ordered list of tasks to be completed by the AI system that do not overlap with incomplete tasks.
Do not remove any tasks. Return the result as a numbered list, like:
#. First task
#. Second task

# Logo Contest
We're going to launch a logo contest to make a logo for Agent-LLM.

Deliverable Specs:
-Must be in SVG format.
-Static colours are prefered vs gradients. 
-Modern / minimal aesthetics are prefered.
-AI generation is completely fine, but it's up to you to convert it into an optimized SVG.

The winner will be credited in the repo description (with a linktree, if desired) for as long as we use your logo.

To submit your logo, simply add the SVG to a /logo_contest directory in the root of the repository on a fork, and make a pull request with the title "Logo Contest - $YourUsername".  That way, you will **officially be listed as a contributor to the repository** if selected! 

We will either make a selection on Friday, or extend the contest with a notification in Discord. Feel free to share this contest with any designers you know!

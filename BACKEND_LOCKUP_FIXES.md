# Backend Lockup Prevention Fixes

## Issue Summary
The AGiXT backend was experiencing lockups where the API would become unresponsive and require full restarts. The primary cause was identified as resource exhaustion, particularly database connection pool exhaustion and inadequate resource management.

## Root Causes Identified

1. **Database Connection Pool Exhaustion**
   - Unlimited overflow connections (`max_overflow=-1`)
   - Sessions not properly closed in error conditions
   - No monitoring of connection pool status

2. **Session Management Problems**
   - Many database sessions weren't closed in finally blocks
   - TaskMonitor had session leakage in error paths
   - No tracking of session lifecycle

3. **Inadequate Resource Monitoring**
   - Resource monitor wasn't effectively tracking database sessions
   - No alerts when approaching resource limits
   - Limited cleanup mechanisms

## Fixes Implemented

### 1. Database Configuration Improvements (`DB.py`)
- **Limited connection pool overflow**: Changed from unlimited (`-1`) to controlled (`10`)
- **Increased base pool size**: From `10` to `20` connections
- **Added connection verification**: `pool_pre_ping=True` to verify connections before use
- **Enhanced session tracking**: Integration with ResourceMonitor for better tracking
- **Added context manager**: `get_db_session()` for automatic session cleanup

### 2. Resource Configuration Updates (`resource_config.py`)
- **Controlled database pool**: `DB_POOL_SIZE=20`, `DB_MAX_OVERFLOW=10`
- **Added monitoring intervals**: `RESOURCE_CLEANUP_INTERVAL=300`
- **Task duration limits**: `MAX_TASK_DURATION=1800` (30 minutes)

### 3. TaskMonitor Fixes (`TaskMonitor.py`)
- **Fixed session handling**: Proper session cleanup in all code paths
- **Enhanced error handling**: Better exception handling with session cleanup
- **Separated session management**: Each task gets its own session that's properly closed

### 4. ResourceMonitor Enhancements (`ResourceMonitor.py`)
- **Database health monitoring**: New `check_database_health()` method
- **Connection pool monitoring**: Alerts when pool utilization is high (>80%)
- **Enhanced cleanup**: Force-close hanging database sessions during emergency cleanup
- **Better logging**: Include database session and browser instance counts in status logs

### 5. Session Tracking System (`session_tracker.py`)
- **New debugging tool**: Track session lifecycle and identify leaks
- **Detailed logging**: Log long-lived sessions with caller information
- **Statistics tracking**: Monitor session creation/closure rates
- **Stack trace capture**: Identify where long-lived sessions are created

### 6. Test Suite (`test_resource_management.py`)
- **Comprehensive testing**: Test database pool, resource monitor, and session tracking
- **Validation tool**: Verify fixes are working correctly
- **Monitoring aid**: Can be run periodically to check system health

## Key Benefits

1. **Prevents Pool Exhaustion**: Limited overflow connections prevent unlimited connection creation
2. **Better Resource Visibility**: Enhanced logging and monitoring of resource usage
3. **Automatic Cleanup**: ResourceMonitor actively manages and cleans up resources
4. **Proactive Alerts**: System warns when approaching resource limits
5. **Debug Capabilities**: Session tracker helps identify and fix future leaks
6. **Improved Stability**: Proper session management prevents accumulation of hanging connections

## Monitoring and Alerts

Enable resource monitoring by setting `LOG_RESOURCE_USAGE=true` in environment variables. This will:
- Log detailed resource status every 5 minutes
- Track active tasks, database sessions, and browser instances
- Alert on high memory usage or connection pool exhaustion
- Log long-lived sessions and potential leaks

## Testing the Fixes

Run the test suite to verify everything is working:
```bash
cd /path/to/agixt
python test_resource_management.py
```

## Production Recommendations

1. **Monitor logs** for resource warnings and alerts
2. **Set up alerts** for high connection pool utilization
3. **Regularly review** session tracker statistics
4. **Consider scaling** if resource limits are consistently hit
5. **Monitor response times** to ensure lockups are resolved

These changes should prevent the backend lockups by ensuring proper resource management and providing early warning when resources are being exhausted.

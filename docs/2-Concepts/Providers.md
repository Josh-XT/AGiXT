# Providers

Providers are the modules or remote services that provide the data that the Agent-LLM uses to generate the reports. The Agent-LLM can use multiple providers at the same time, and each provider can be configured to use different credentials and settings.

For example: OpenAI, Google Bard, Microsoft Bing, GPT4Free are remote providers. GPT4All, llamacpp, and Oobabooga are local providers that runs on your computer/server.

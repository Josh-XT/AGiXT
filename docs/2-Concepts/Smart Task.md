Sure, I can help rephrase and explain your process for creating highly intelligent Language Learning Models (LLMs) that can efficiently complete tasks. 

Here's a more detailed explanation:

1. **Task Definition:** The user provides the LLM with a specific task to accomplish. This task serves as the objective that the LLM will work towards.

2. **Task Breakdown:** The Task Agent, an AI component, analyzes the main task and generates a list of subtasks necessary for its completion. 

3. **Task Execution Loop:** The Task Agent enters a loop where it utilizes a Smart Instruct process for each subtask. 

4. **Task Prioritization:** After the completion of each subtask, the AI reevaluates and reprioritizes the remaining tasks. This helps in minimizing redundancy and overlapping work.

5. **Loop Continuation:** The process continues, looping back to the Smart Instruct step until all the tasks in the list are completed.

Within this process, the Smart Instruct system is responsible for completing individual tasks. You can

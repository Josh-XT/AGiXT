# AGiXT Hubs

AGiXT Hubs exist to give you flexibility in what extensions, providers, prompts, agents, and chains your AGiXT instance imports when starting. The [Open Source AGiXT Hub](https://github.com/AGiXT/hub) contains the open source items that are available for use with AGiXT.  You can also create your own AGiXT Hub and use it with AGiXT if you would like to use it with your own private extensions, providers, prompts, agents, and chains.

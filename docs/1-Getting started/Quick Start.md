## Quick Start Guide

To get started quickly, you can use the Docker deployment. You will need [docker and docker-compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/) installed on your system.

Open a terminal and run the following commands:

```
git clone https://github.com/Josh-XT/AGiXT
cd AGiXT
docker-compose up -d
```

Follow the prompts to install the required dependencies.  Any time you want to run AGiXT in the future, just run `docker-compose up -d` again from the `AGiXT` directory.

- Access the web interface at http://localhost:8501
- Access the AGiXT API documentation at http://localhost:7437

# Jive SSO Integration

This document provides a detailed guide on integrating Jive Single Sign-On (SSO) with your application. By following these instructions, you will be able to set up environment variables and acquire the necessary OAuth keys for Jive.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure that you have the following prerequisites:

- A Jive account with the necessary permissions to create an OAuth application.
- Access to your Jive instance to perform API operations.
- Python environment set up with necessary libraries, including `requests` and `fastapi`.

## Required Environment Variables

Set up the following environment variables in your `.env` file or environment management system. These variables will be used for OAuth authentication with Jive.

- `JIVE_CLIENT_ID`: Jive OAuth client ID.
- `JIVE_CLIENT_SECRET`: Jive OAuth client secret.

## How to Acquire Jive OAuth Keys

1. **Log in to your Jive instance.**

2. **Navigate to the OAuth section:**
   - Go to `Admin Console > System > Settings > OAuth`.

3. **Create a new OAuth application:**
   - Click on "Register a New Application".
   - Fill out the application form with relevant information:
     - **Application Name**: Choose a name for your application.
     - **Client ID**: This will be provided by the system once you register the application.
     - **Client Secret**: This will also be provided by the system upon registering the application.
     - **Redirect URI**: Enter the URL where users will be redirected after authentication. This is typically your application's URL.
     - **Scopes**: Select the scopes your application will require as per Jive's API documentation.
       - Example Scopes: `read`, `write`, `admin`, etc.

4. **Save the application:**
   - Once you save the application, the `Client ID` and `Client Secret` will be generated. Note these down as you will need them for your environment variables.

5. **Add environment variables:**
   - Add the `JIVE_CLIENT_ID` and `JIVE_CLIENT_SECRET` to your `.env` file or manage them in your service's environment configuration.

## Required APIs

Ensure you have the necessary Jive API enabled to perform operations such as fetching user information and sending emails.

## Required Scopes for Jive OAuth

The required scopes for Jive OAuth will depend on what operations you wish to perform. Commonly used scopes include:

- **Read**: To read user information.
- **Write**: To send emails or perform other writing operations.
- **Admin**: For administrative tasks.

Refer to Jiveï¿½s API documentation for a detailed list of available scopes.

## Setting Environment Variables

Add the following lines to your `.env` file:

```env
JIVE_CLIENT_ID=your_jive_client_id
JIVE_CLIENT_SECRET=your_jive_client_secret
```

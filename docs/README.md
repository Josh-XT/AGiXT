## Quickstart with Docker
Clone the repository and run the AGiXT Streamlit Web App.
```
git clone https://github.com/Josh-XT/AGiXT
docker compose --profile streamlit up
```

- Web Interface http://localhost:8501
### Windows Docker Desktop (streamlit only example)
- Container Name: AGiXT
- Host Port: 8501:8501/tcp

### Alternative Docker Compose Profiles

Run all available services, this includes the FastAPI back end (Port 7437) and NextJS front end (Port 3000).
```
docker compose --profile all up
```

### Development using docker
```
git clone https://github.com/Josh-XT/AGiXT
docker compose --profile all -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.dev.yaml up
```

## Local Development

Clone the repository for the AGiXT back end and start it.

#### Install poetry
`pip install poetry==1.5.0`
Check if poetry is available via
`poetry --version`
or
`python3 -m poetry --version`
Adapt the following commands accordingly.

#### Setup AGiXT
```
git clone https://github.com/Josh-XT/AGiXT && cd AGiXT
pip install poetry==1.5.0
export PYTHON_KEYRING_BACKEND=keyring.backends.null.Keyring
poetry install --with gpt4free
playwright install
cd agixt
```

#### Run Streamlit 
`poetry run streamlit run Main.py`

#### Run REST
`poetry run uvicorn app:app --port 7437`


Access the web interface at http://localhost:8501

### API Endpoints

AGiXT provides several API endpoints for managing agents, prompts and chains.

If you're not running with Docker, the back end can be run with:
```
python agixt/app.py
```

To learn more about the API endpoints and their usage, visit the API documentation at 
- [Swagger](http://localhost:7437)
- [Redoc](http://localhost:7437/redoc)

This documentation is hosted locally and the frontend must be running for these links to work.
## Configuration

Each AGiXT Agent has its own settings for interfacing with AI providers, and other configuration options. These settings can be set and modified through the web interface.
